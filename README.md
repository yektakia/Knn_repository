# Knn_repository
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) project is typically a machine learning or data analysis task where the goal is to classify data points or make predictions based on their proximity to other data points
KNN Project.

Importing Dataset:
Using one of the data manipulation libraries in Python (for example, pandas), read the CSV file as input.

Preprocessing:
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
The goal of this section is to familiarize you with the dataset.
Identify the type of each column.
Print the first and last 10 rows.
Print the number of rows and columns.
For each feature (column), print the maximum and minimum values.

Data Cleaning:
In this section, prepare the dataset for modeling based on the following:
There are some missing values in this dataset:
Some entries are left empty.
Some data values are replaced with "???" instead of actual values.
There are some duplicate samples in this dataset.

Data Normalization:
Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature (column) and normalize the data in that column so that the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one.

Processing:
Getting Input:
Take new data along with its features as input and normalize each feature using the mean and standard deviation of that feature from the original data.

Modeling:
Compare each feature of the new data with the same feature from the original data and calculate the differences (Euclidean distances). Sort these differences and select the data points that have the smallest difference from the new data. Using majority voting among these selected data points, determine the class of the new data and output the result.
